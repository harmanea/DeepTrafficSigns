# DeepTrafficSigns
This is a repository for everything related to my bachelor's thesis. It continues the work started in my [seminar project](github.com/harmanea/DeepTraffic).

## Scripts

Most scripts require tensorflow and numpy.

### train.py

The train.py script begins the training of a new model with the architecture proposed in this thesis. It accepts four arguments. The first one is the path to the data folder generated by the merge_datasets.py script. The other three arguments are either True or False and they toggle different settings in this order - greyscale, histogram_normalisation, data_augmentation.

Example usage:

    python3 train.py datasets/data/ True False False
    # for a greyscale model with no histogram normalisation and no data augmentation

### label_image.py

The label_image.py script loads a model and tries to classify the provided image.

Example usage:

    python3 label_image.py
    # to label the provided example_sign.jpg
   
    python3 label_image.py --image=another_image.jpg
    # to label a different image
   
    python3 label_image.py --model=path/to/another_model.h5
    # to load a different keras model for the classification
   
    python3 label_image.py --grayscale=True --normalize=True
    # converts the labeled image to grayscale and applies histogram equalization
   
    python3 label_image.py --help
    # for more information and options
